**If your device does not have an internet connection, you will see a toast message.
In some cases you may see popup message due to too many api requests.
You can saved countries in home tab and see saved tab..
You can remove saved countries if you want from any fragment (homeFragment,detailFragment or savedFragment)**

***Please dont't forget put your API_KEY into AppModule!!***
